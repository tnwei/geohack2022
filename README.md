# APGCE Geohack 2022

Compilation of the hard work done by all teams in this hackathon!

+ [Team 2: TriloBYTES](https://github.com/lawmayy/geohack2022-panna-cotta): Blank seismic infill across offsets using convolutional autoencoders
+ [Team 3: Banana Leaf](https://github.com/haizadtarik/ai-well-top-picker): Machine learning for picking formation tops from well logs
+ [Team 5: All Is Wells](https://github.com/AnselmAdrian/geohack): DTS well log prediction and missing log data imputation, for well logs with similar intervals
+ [Team 6: Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/maisaramajid/geohack2022-team06): Formation classification from well logs
+ [Team 11: Run Data Run](https://github.com/haikalbaik/GeoHackathon2022): Formation top prediction with machine learning

## Participant instructions for code submission

1. Set up a `github.com` account, and create a new repository: `geohack2022-team<YOUR-TEAM-NUMBER>` e.g. `geohack2022-team11`. 
2. In your VM project folder, run `git init` to set up a local git repo.
3. For each code file that you want to upload, do `git add FILENAME>. You can add a whole folder e.g. `code-folder` by doing `git add code-folder`.
4. `git commit -m "initial commit"`
5. `git branch -M main`
6. `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/geohack2022-team<YOUR-TEAM-NUMBER>.git`
7. `git push -u origin main`. You will need to set up authentication to your github account here.
8. Let me know and I'll add your repo to the list!

We would like to ask you to include the following in your code repo. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with this, we'll help you! 

1. README.md file that contains a brief description of your work, and also names of team members (and contact info if you are willing)
2. MIT license
