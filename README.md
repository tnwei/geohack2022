# APGCE Geohack 2022

Compilation of the hard work done by all teams in this hackathon!

+ [Team 5: All Is Wells](https://github.com/AnselmAdrian/geohack): DTS well log prediction and missing log data imputation, for well logs with similar intervals
+ [Team 6](https://github.com/maisaramajid/geohack2022-team06)

## Participant instructions for code submission

1. Set up a `github.com` account, and create a new repository: `geohack2022-team<YOUR-TEAM-NUMBER>` e.g. `geohack2022-team11`. 
2. In your VM project folder, run `git init` to set up a local git repo.
3. For each code file that you want to upload, do `git add FILENAME>. You can add a whole folder e.g. `code-folder` by doing `git add code-folder`.
4. `git commit -m "initial commit"`
5. `git branch -M main`
6. `git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/geohack2022-team<YOUR-TEAM-NUMBER>.git`
7. `git push -u origin main`. You will need to set up authentication to your github account here.

We would like to ask you to include the following in your code repo. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with this, we'll help you! 

1. README.md file that contains a brief description of your work, and also names of team members (and contact info if you are willing)
2. MIT license
